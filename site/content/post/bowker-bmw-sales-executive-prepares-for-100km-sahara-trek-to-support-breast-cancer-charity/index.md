Alison Prowse, who overcame stage 3 breast cancer after her diagnosis in 2020, is undertaking the challenge to mark the five-year anniversary of her diagnosis. The trek involves five days of walking through Morocco’s deserts, valleys, and gorges, culminating in camping under the stars with fellow participants.

Alison hopes to raise £3,000 for CoppaFeel\! to support its mission of encouraging early detection of breast cancer in young people.

Alison said: “2020 was such a tough year for me, but I made it through thanks to so many people’s support. This trek is my way of giving back. With it coinciding with the five years since my diagnosis, it will also be an important milestone for me personally. I’ll be trekking across the desert and sleeping in the open. It will be tough. But I am determined to make it.”

The Sahara Desert trek challenges participants to cover 100km over five days, trekking up to eight hours daily in temperatures exceeding 30°C. The itinerary includes climbing Djebel Zereg (known for its distinctive reddish-black volcanic rock), traversing the Tikertouachene River, and camping in the heart of Morocco’s awe-inspiring desert landscapes.

CoppaFeel\! is the UK’s only breast cancer awareness charity targeting young people. It educates 18 to 24-year-olds on the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, empowering them to seek medical advice early. The charity highlights that early detection significantly improves treatment success rates and survival outcomes.

Alison added: “CoppaFeel\! is a cause close to my heart because early detection saved my life. Every penny raised will help educate more young people and fund their vital work. It would mean the world if people could donate even the price of a coffee to help me reach my target.”

In 2022, 14 Bowker Motor Group employees successfully raised more than £500 for local charity Hug in a Bag by completing the ‘Born Survivor Mud Run’. The Bowker workmates’ successful challenge was dedicated to their friend and fellow employee, Alison Prowse, who returned to work earlier this year after fighting breast cancer for more than two years.
